Research Paper Recommendation System (AI-Based)
📌 Overview
The AI-Powered Research Paper Recommendation System helps students and researchers discover relevant research papers based on their queries and reading interests.

Users can search, rate, and explore research papers. Based on their interactions, the system recommends similar papers using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The project also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with tkinter for an interactive experience.
🚀 Features
•	🔍 Search for research papers
•	⭐ Rate papers based on interest
•	🤖 Get AI-powered recommendations using cosine similarity & TF-IDF
•	🖥 GUI with tkinter for easy interaction
•	🛠 Extendable for large datasets in the future
🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
•	pandas, numpy → Data manipulation
•	scikit-learn → TF-IDF, cosine similarity
•	tkinter → GUI interface
•	threading, datetime → App enhancements
